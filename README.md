Welcome to this task  <br>
Which is rather easy  <br>
I only have one ask  <br>
That needs some scp  <br>

```
scp martin@192.168.1.3:~/CLUE.zip ./
```
But the problem is alas, <br>
you don't know the word of pass <br>
But a solution is at hand <br>
For those who will scavenge <br>
I have set up a network for fun <br>
That is called Scavenger Hunt <br>
The password of this network too <br>
Is the password for getting the clue <br>
So you know must only get and break <br>
This networks wifi handhshake <br>
To enable your Pi to do so <br>
To some equipment you will go <br>
Go to the office of the Dean <br>
By Gabby (the secretary) seen <br>
Then tell her I am a scavenger <br>
May I have some sweets <br>
This antenne is a wifi card <br>
That allows you to go hard <br>
Control your pi through ssh <br>
While also running the attack <br>
Gather like we did in class <br>
Then crack the password fast <br>
With 

```
aircrack-ng -w password.lst Scav.pcap
```

and this password list 

```
scp kali@192.168.1.200:~/password.lst ./
```
